/** \brief manages all managed Chunks of raw memory
 *
 * This object tracks the dimesions and status of a chunk of memory we manage.
 * The status is inherently connected to the logic we can operate on the object and
 * it is basically prescribed what classes may change the status from wich state to which.
 * Even though it would be more clear to have convenience and thread-safe functions here,
 * we decided for this due to performance issues. More documentation to come. The basically
 * possible transitions are depicted in the following graph:
